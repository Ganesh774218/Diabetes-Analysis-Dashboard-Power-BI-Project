### **📊 Diabetes Analysis Dashboard — Detailed Insights Report**



* This Power BI report synthesizes insights from the Diabetes dataset to illuminate patterns, risk indicators, and demographic relationships associated with diabetes.
* Using interactive visualizations and aggregations, the analysis identifies population segments with elevated risk, highlights key clinical and lifestyle predictors, and reveals how prevalence and outcomes vary by age, gender, and other demographic factors.
* The dashboard supports exploratory filtering and trend analysis so stakeholders can investigate correlations, monitor high‑risk groups, and prioritize intervention strategies.
* Findings are presented with clear KPI summaries and visual evidence to inform clinicians, public‑health planners, and data‑driven decision makers about where to focus screening, prevention, and resource-allocation efforts.

**Interpretation:**

* High average BMI and above-normal glucose levels indicate a population with a potentially high metabolic risk.





#### **📈 2. Patient Count by Diabetes Risk**



* High Risk: 297 patients (38.67%)



* Medium Risk: 274 patients (35.68%)



* Low Risk: 197 patients (25.65%)



**Key Insight:**

* More than 74% of patients fall under Medium to High risk, indicating strong correlations with glucose, BMI, and age.





#### 

#### **🧬 3. Average Glucose by Age**



The line chart shows a clear upward trend in glucose levels with age.



**Major Highlights:**



* Ages 20–30 → ~106 mg/dL (relatively normal)



* Ages 40–50 → ~150 mg/dL (elevated)



* Ages 55–65 → Peak values of 170+ mg/dL



* Post 65 → Slight decline to ~134 mg/dL



**Insight:**

* Glucose levels rise significantly with age, especially between 40–60, making this the critical age band for preventive healthcare.

#### **💉 4. Average Insulin by Age Category**

**| Age Category       | Avg Insulin |**

**| ------------------ | ----------- |**

**| \*\*Less than 30\*\*   | 84.39       |**

**| \*\*30–50\*\*          | 70.76       |**

**| \*\*High Age (>50)\*\* | 89.83       |**



**Insight:**

High-age group shows highest insulin levels, indicating insulin resistance.

Mid-age (30–50) shows a dip, likely due to lifestyle variations.





#### 

#### **🫀 5. Average Blood Pressure by Age Category**

**| Age Group          | Avg Blood Pressure |**

**| ------------------ | ------------------ |**

**| \*\*Less Than 30\*\*   | 65.35              |**

**Insight:**

* Blood pressure steadily increases with age.
* High BP in high-age groups indicates elevated cardiovascular risk alongside diabetes.







#### **⚖️ 6. BMI Distribution by BMI Category**

* Over 70% of patients are obese, making BMI one of the strongest predictors of diabetes risk in this dataset.







#### **👶 7. Age Distribution by BMI and Diabetes Risk**



The matrix table shows:



* Most patients fall in the 30–50 age category, especially in Obese and Overweight segments.



* Younger patients (<30) also show obesity, indicating early metabolic issues.



**Insight:**

* Obesity is not limited to older individuals—younger patients also show high BMI and diabetes risk.







#### **🧪 8. Diabetes Risk by Scaled Target (Gauge Chart)**



* Average Scaled Diabetes Risk = 19.53



* Minimum = 0.00



* Maximum = 39.06



**Insight:**

* The risk score positions the population in the mid-to-high risk zone.







#### **📌 Summary of Key Insights**



**1. High Diabetes Risk Population**

* More than 74% fall into Medium or High risk categories.



**2. BMI is the strongest predictor**

* With 70% obese, obesity strongly correlates with diabetes risk.



**3. Glucose levels increase with age**

* Ages 40–60 show the highest glucose spikes.



**4. Blood Pressure and Insulin also rise with age**

* Indicating a multi-factor metabolic syndrome trend.



**5. Younger patients are also at risk**

* Obesity and glucose irregularities are not limited to older ages.



**6. Pregnancies contribute to risk**

* Higher pregnancy counts correlate with elevated glucose and BMI patterns.
