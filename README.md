# Diabetes-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
 🩺 Diabetes Analysis Dashboard — Power BI Project

 📌 Project Overview

⦁	This project analyzes a diabetes dataset using **Power BI**, focusing on identifying factors influencing diabetes risk, understanding patient demographics, and visualizing medical indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, and blood pressure.
The dashboard provides **actionable insights** into patient health distribution across age groups and BMI categories, helping support early detection and health-risk assessment.


📊 Key Objectives

* Understand overall patient health metrics
* Analyze diabetes risk distribution
* Identify high-risk age groups
* Compare glucose, insulin, and blood pressure across age categories
* Study BMI categories and their relation to diabetes risk
* Provide KPI metrics for quick decision-making


 📈 Key KPIs

* **Total Patients:** 768
* **Average BMI:** 32
* **Average Glucose:** 121 mg/dL
* **Average Pregnancies:** 4
* **Average Skin Thickness:** 21 mm
* **Total Pregnancies Count:** 657


 📉 Visuals Included in the Dashboard

 **1. Patient Count by Diabetes Risk (Donut Chart)**

Shows distribution of patients labeled as **High, Medium, Low risk** based on DiabetesRisk%.

**Insight:**

* High Risk: ~38%
* Medium Risk: ~36%
* Low Risk: ~26%


 **2. Glucose Trend by Age (Line Chart)**

Displays glucose level variations across age range (21–81).
**Insight:** Glucose peaks around ages **50–60**, indicating high-risk middle-age groups.


 **3. Blood Pressure by Age Category (Bar Chart)**

Three groups:

* Less than 30
* 30–50
* High Age (50+)

**Insight:**

* Highest average BP: **High Age group – 78.38 mg/dL**
* Lowest average BP: **<30 group – 65.35 mg/dL**


 **4. Insulin Levels by Age Category (Bar Chart)**

**Insight:**

* Insulin is highest in High Age category (~89.83)
* Indicates reduced insulin efficiency in older patients.


 **5. BMI Category Distribution (Pie Chart)**

Categories: Normal, Overweight, Obese, Underweight

**Insight:**

* **Obese:** 70% of population
* **Overweight:** 20%
* Majority fall into overweight/obese → high diabetes probability.


 **6. Diabetes Risk by Scaled Target (Gauge Chart)**

Scaled risk score showing severity on a 0–39 scale.
**Average Scaled Risk:** ~19.53


 **7. Sales-Style Breakdown: Age Bins × BMI Category (Matrix Table)**

(Not sales but patient distribution).
Shows how many patients fall into each BMI group based on age bin.

**Insight:**
* Age 30–50 group has the highest Obesity count (14897+)
* Less than 30 has higher Normal/Underweight proportion than older groups.

 🧠 Major Insights from the Dashboard
1. **Most patients are overweight or obese**, which strongly correlates with higher diabetes risk.
2. **Glucose levels peak between age 50–60**, indicating older patients need prioritization.
3. **Insulin resistance increases with age**, seen through rising insulin averages.
4. **Blood pressure rises significantly in older age groups**, increasing overall metabolic risk.
5. **High diabetes risk category holds the largest patient group (~38%)**, requiring focus on medical intervention.
6. **Young patients (<30) show the lowest risk indicators**—lower glucose, BP, and insulin.
7. **BMI and age are strong predictors of diabetes risk severity.**
